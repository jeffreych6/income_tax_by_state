# Income Tax by State

## Background

This project is a data visualizer web application that shows all state individual tax rates across the US for the current year along with the estimated tax owed according to the specified income. The goal of this application is to provide users a simple way of learning how much tax each state charges for a given income.

## Functionality

In this data visualizer, users will be able to:

- See which states have the highest/lowest tax rates based off color
- Hover over states to display state tax rate and estimated income tax
- Adjust income with a slider to meet individual needs
- Select different filing statuses to meet individual needs
- Click on individual states for detailed breakdown of taxes owed
